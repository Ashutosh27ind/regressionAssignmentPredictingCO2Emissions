 Predicting CO2 Emissions Using Other Variables (for a given year)
 
Let's now try to build a regression model to predict CO2 emissions using other variables (for any given year). This will help us in understanding which variables affect CO2 emissions. This understanding can then be used by, for example, organisations/authorities such as the UN, governments etc. to create regulatory policies etc.
